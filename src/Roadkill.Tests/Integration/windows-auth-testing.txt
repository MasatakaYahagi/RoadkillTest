=====TESTING WINDOWS AUTHENTICATION=====

This can be done by creating a new Windows 2012 server and running into inside VirtualBox or on EC2.

To setup the box from fresh and perform manual tests:

Install IIS (including application support)
Install Active Directory Domain Services, call your domain Contoso.com (you'll need a new forest).
The two user groups are RoadkillEditors, RoadkillAdmins. I then setup two users to belong to each:
BobAdmin - RoadkillAdmins
EricEditor - RoadkillEditors

Logout and login as both of these users to test they add pages and administer the site. If using a remote server, add
these two users to the Administrators group to enable remote desktop access.

The Roadkill ldap settings are then:
-	ldapConnectionString: LDAP://contoso.com
-	ldapUsername: administrator
-	ldapPassword: Passw0rd

Use SQLite for the database.


roadkill.config:

<roadkill
	adminRoleName="RoadkillAdmins"
	attachmentsFolder="~/App_Data/Attachments"
	useObjectCache="false"
	useBrowserCache="false"
	logging="none"
	logErrorsOnly="true"
	connectionStringName="Roadkill"
	dataStoreType="SqlServerCe"
	editorRoleName="RoadkillEditors"
	installed="true"
	isPublicSite="true"
	useWindowsAuthentication="true"
	ldapConnectionString="LDAP://contoso.com"
	ldapUsername="administrator"
	ldapPassword="Passw0rd"
