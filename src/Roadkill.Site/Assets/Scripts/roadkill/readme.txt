Make sure you have the web essentials Visual Studio plugin installed before editing any of
the Typescript files - this plugin automatically runs the Typescript compiler. 
All the file.js files (not the min versions) are bundled by the ASP.NET bundler.

The typescript-ref folder contains files to assist Typescript, none of the js files are included 
by the bundler or on the site.
