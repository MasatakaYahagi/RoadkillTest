Upgrading to 1.5
==================================

To upgrade from versions 1.3 and 1.4 to 1.5, you can simply copy over the existing folders and files in your installation. 
Make sure you do a backup of you existing site first!

1) Firstly, delete your /App_Data/Search folder - version 1.5 uses a newer version of the Lucene.NET search engine, so conflicts may occur if you don't do this.
2) Delete the following folders (this should ensure no caching problems occur):
	/Assets
	/Bin
	/Themes
	/Views

3) Copy the following folders:
	/Assets
	/Bin
	/Themes
	/Views

4) Copy the following files, overwriting the existing files:
	/App_Data/tokens.xml
	/Global.asax
	/mimetypes.config

5) If you're using SQLite, copy "System.Data.SQLite.dll" and "System.Data.SQLite.Linq.dll" from /App_Data/SQLiteBinaries (use x64 if you're on 64bit, otherwise x86) to your /bin folder
