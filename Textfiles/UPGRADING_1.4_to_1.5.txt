Upgrading to 1.5
==================================

To upgrade from versions 1.3 and 1.4 to v1.5, you need copy over the existing folders and files in your installation and delete some folders first. 
It's slightly trickier than previous upgrades, but is necessary as there have been a number of upgrades that are not backward compatible.

You DO NOT need to change your web.config file, this can remain untouched.

Make sure you do a backup of you existing site first!

1) Firstly, delete your /App_Data/Search folder - version 1.5 uses a newer version of the Lucene.NET search engine, so conflicts may occur if you don't do this.
2) Delete the following folders:
	/Assets
	/Bin
	/Themes
	/Views

3) Copy the following folders:
	/Assets
	/Bin
	/Themes
	/Views

4) Copy the following files, overwriting the existing files:
	/App_Data/tokens.xml
	/Global.asax
	/mimetypes.config

5) If you're using SQLite, copy "System.Data.SQLite.dll" and "System.Data.SQLite.Linq.dll" from /App_Data/SQLiteBinaries (use x64 if you're on 64bit, otherwise x86) to your /bin folder
