Upgrading to 1.5
==================================

To upgrade from versions 1.3 and 1.4 to v1.5, you need copy over the existing folders and files in your installation and 
delete some folders first. It's slightly trickier than previous upgrades, but is necessary as there have been a number 
of upgrades that are not backward compatible.

You DO NOT need to change your web.config file, this can remain untouched.

Make sure you do a backup of you existing site first!

1) Firstly, delete the /App_Data/Search folder from your Roadkill site - version 1.5 uses a newer version of the 
Lucene.NET search engine, so conflicts may occur if you don't do this.

2) Delete the following folders from your Roadkill site:
	/Assets
	/Bin
	/Themes
	/Views

3) Unzip Roadkill_v1.5.zip somewhere.

4) Copy the following folders from the unzip directory:
	/Assets
	/Bin
	/Themes
	/Views

5) Copy the following files from the unzip directory, overwriting the existing files:
	/App_Data/tokens.xml
	/Global.asax
	/mimetypes.config

6) If you're using SQLite, copy "System.Data.SQLite.dll" and "System.Data.SQLite.Linq.dll" from /App_Data/SQLiteBinaries 
in the from the unzip directory (use x64 if you're on 64bit, otherwise x86) to your /bin folder

7) Rebuild the search index inside the Site settings->Tools.
