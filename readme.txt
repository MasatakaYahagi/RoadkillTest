=====PRE-REQUISITES FOR VISUAL STUDIO=====
You will need Typescript installed to open the Roadkill.Site project - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=34790
The typescript files are setup to be compiled when you compile the project (Javascript compile-time checking, woohoo).

To run all the integration tests, you should install Mongodb, http://chocolatey.org/packages?q=mongodb is the easiest way to do this.

=====PROBLEMS WITH SQLITE=====
If you get yellow screen of deaths with a SQLiteinterop.dll message, remove that file from bin folder.

=====BUILD README=====
The steps below are also in the releasebuild.ps1 file.
These are the steps to create a new download version:

Firstly for the version being released: 
	Commit to Hg 
	Use hg tag v1.x.x for the version.
	Use hg push
	Use hg branch v1.x.x for the version (as a branch is far easier to apply fixes to later)
	Use hg commit
	Use hg push

1) Update the version in AssemblyInfo.cs in Core and Site
2) Compile using the 'Download' configuration
3) Publish the site to a folder
4) Copy the following files from the /TextFiles folder to the publish folder
	- /TextFiles/install.txt - update the version number
	- /TextFiles/license.txt
	- /TextFiles/upgradeXXX.txt (if required)
5) Copy /lib/System.Data.SqlServerCe.dll to the publish /bin folder (publish leaves it out for some reason)
6) Copy /lib/Microsoft.Web.Administration.dll to the publish /bin folder (publish leaves it out for some reason)
7) Copy /lib/Empty-databases/roadkill.sqlite to the publish /App_Data folder
8) Copy /lib/Empty-databases/roadkill.sdf to the publish /App_Data folder
9) Copy /lib/Empty-databases/roadkill.mdf to the publish /App_Data folder
10) Zip up using the name 'Roadkill_v{number}.zip' e.g. Roadkill_v1.3.zip, add to the downloads on bitbucket/codeplex.

=====DEV WEB.CONFIG====
The web.config for the site is unlikely to work when you pull the latest from Bitbucket, it could
be in any state from the previous commit. Copy the web.dev.config from the \lib\Configs directory 
and overwrite the web.config in the site folder with this.

Don't worry about committing your web.config, the Web.Download.config file is used for release packages.

=====TESTING WINDOWS AUTH=====

This can be done by creating a new Windows 2012 server and running into inside VirtualBox or on EC2.
There is an image on EC2 to do this, which runs some of the Acceptance tests as a set of basic smoke 
tests to ensure you can create a page, edit etc. These are run as the bobadmin user.

To setup the box from fresh and perform manual tests:

Install IIS (including application support)
Install Active Directory Domain Services, call your domain Contoso.com.
The two user groups are RoadkillEditors, RoadkillAdmins. I then setup two users to belong to each:
BobAdmin - RoadkillAdmins
EricEditor - RoadkillEditors

Logout and login as both of these users to test they add pages and administer the site. If using a remote server, add
these two users to the Administrators group to enable remote desktop access.

The Roadkill ldap settings are then:
-	ldapConnectionString: LDAP://contoso.com
-	ldapUsername: administrator
-	ldapPassword: Passw0rd

Use SQLite for the database.
