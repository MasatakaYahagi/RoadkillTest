Roadkill .NET Wiki engine

Version 1.6

Pre-requisites:
------------------------
* .NET Framework 4.0
* IIS7+ is preferred, the app has not been tested with IIS6

Installation
------------------------

1) Create your website or virtual directory in IIS
2) If using SQL Server: create a database and assign it a login (dbo is best)
3) Copy the contents of this folder to the IIS directory you previously made.
4) Point your browser to the URL - the installer will do the rest for you.
5) If you want to use SQLite for your database, copy either App_Data\SQLiteBinaries\x64\SQLite.Interop.dll
 or App_Data\SQLiteBinaries\x86\SQLite.Interop.dll to your bin folder, depending which architecture you're running
Roadkill on.
