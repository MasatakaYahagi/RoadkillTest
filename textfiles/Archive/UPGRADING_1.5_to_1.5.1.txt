Upgrading to 1.5.1
==================================

Version 1.5.1 is a maintenance release, fixing a number of issues that were found in 1.5.

As always, backup your site before upgrading. To upgrade to 1.5.1, copy the following files and folders:

/App_Data/htmlwhitelist.xml
/Assets
/bin
/Themes
/Views
/Global.asax
/mimetypes.config

In version 1.5.1 a new HTML whitelist is used, which removes all tags that aren't inside /App_Data/htmlwhitelist.xml.
If you are finding problems with this feature (which is for security), you can disable it in your web.config using:

  <roadkill ... 
	useHtmlWhiteList="false" />
