Upgrading to version 1.7
==================================

Before upgrading, please make a back up of your database and website. To upgrade, simply copy all the files except the web.config file.

The custom tokens filename has changed, and is now known as "customvariables.xml" in the App_Data folder.
If you have changed your tokens.xml, you will need to rename this to "customvariables.xml".

Once everything is complete, you should update your web.config so the roadkill section's
version="1.6.0.0" is set to version="1.7.0.0".
